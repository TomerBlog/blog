# **Getting Started with EntraGoat: Breaking Entra ID the Smart Way**

[**EntraGoat**](https://github.com/Semperis/EntraGoat/) is a deliberately vulnerable lab that simulates real-world identity misconfigurations in Microsoft Entra ID. Whether you're a red teamer, blue teamer, or just curious about identity attacks, this guide will walk you through how to set up EntraGoat, launch your first challenge, and start capturing flags like a pro.

## What is EntraGoat?

Imagine a playground where you can:

* Escalate a user to Global Admin
* Chain permissions via the Graph API
* Abuse misconfigured apps and service principals
* Activate privileged roles to reset global admin’s MFA
* Simulate attacks without endangering production environments

That’s exactly what **EntraGoat** offers: a CTF-style platform for identity exploitation learning in the cloud (*Figure 1*).

## Getting started with EntraGoat: What you need

Before we get our hooves dirty, here’s what you need:

* A **test Microsoft Entra ID tenant** (*E5 trial* works great)
* **Global Administrator** privileges in that tenant
* **Node.js + npm** installed
* **PowerShell 7+**
* Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK (*Figure 2*)

## Step 1: Clone and launch the lab

Fire up your terminal and run the script that *Figure 3* shows.

![](git.png)

*Figure 3. Cloning the EntraGoat lab*

Then open your browser to: <http://localhost:3000>

As *Figure 4* shows, each challenge comes with a backstory, credentials, hints, and a place to submit the flag.

## Step 2: Launch your first challenge

Once the EntraGoat dashboard is live at <http://localhost:3000>, you can launch any scenario using either of **two methods.**

### Option 1: Download and deploy via web interface

1. From the dashboard, click on a challenge (e.g., Scenario 1: Misowned and Dangerous).
2. In the **Challenge View**, click:
   1. **View Setup Script** -> Download the setup script
   2. **View Cleanup Script** -> Download the cleanup script (optional)
3. Run the downloaded PowerShell script from your terminal

Each challenge page lets you download setup and cleanup scripts directly (*Figure 5*).

Once, you’ve downloaded the setup script, run the scenario using the setup command (*Figure 6*).

### Option 2: Run directly from the Scenarios folder

If you cloned the repo locally, you can skip downloading and run the scripts straight from the terminal (*Figure 7*).

Either method sets up the same environment. Use what fits your workflow, GUI-first or terminal-only.

## Step 3: Explore, attack, escalate

You now have:

* Valid user credentials
* A vulnerable, misconfigured Entra ID environment
* And... a flag hidden under the admin properties. Get it after you sign in as a Global Administrator.

Use the Azure portal, Microsoft Entra admin center, Microsoft Graph PowerShell, or Graph Explorer to:

* Enumerate user-linked resources
* Check for ownership over apps or groups
* Review assigned roles and privileged eligibility pathways

If you’re stuck, use the in-platform hints to guide your thinking. They’re designed to support attacker-style reasoning without disclosing full solutions.

## Step 4: Capture the flag

Your objective is to retrieve the flag after gaining Global Administrator access, validating the scenario’s intended impact.

EntraGoat{SP\_0wn3rsh1p\_Pr1v\_Esc@l@t10n\_Congratz!}

Paste the flag into the challenge page and mark the challenge complete! Then, you’ll get access to the next one.

**NOTE:** By default, all authenticated users in Entra ID can query basic profile data of other users, and attributes like extensionAttribute1–15 aren’t classified as sensitive. As a result, the flag stored in the Admin’s profile can technically be retrieved immediately with the API query that *Figure 8* shows.

*Figure 8. Shortcut to flag retrieval*

This behavior is intentional. The goal of EntraGoat is not to hide the flag but to demonstrate realistic privilege escalation techniques in Entra ID environments. Retrieving the flag via a direct API call is possible; but the real objective is to escalate privileges, access the Azure portal as the admin user, and view the flag in their UI, demonstrating full control over a Global Administrator identity (*Figure 9*).

The flag is a gamified artifact to validate completion, not the primary objective of the scenario.

## Step 5: Clean it up

After each scenario, you can roll back the changes (*Figure 10*).

No messy leftovers in your tenant.

## Want to go deeper?

Each scenario comes with a complete **walkthrough script** and **step-by-step solution file** you can use to:

* Teach others
* Understand the mechanics behind each attack path
* Automate your tests
* Build new attack chains

You’ll find them under: */solutions/*

## Learn, practice, and defend with EntraGoat

EntraGoat is more than a lab environment. It provides an on-demand platform to explore Entra ID attack paths, develop effective defense strategies, and apply that knowledge to strengthen real-world environments.
